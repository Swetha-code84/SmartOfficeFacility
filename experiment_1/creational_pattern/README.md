# CREATIONAL PATTERN

## Factory Method

                                             Interactive Document Creator
                                             
The Factory Method Pattern is used to delegate the creation of a specific document product (TextDocument or SpreadsheetDocument) to its corresponding application subclass, ensuring the correct type is instantiated and initialized based on the user's interactive choice.

## Singleton Pattern

                                            System Health Monitor
                                            
The Singleton Pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of the System Health Monitor controls the dedicated, thread-safe background process responsible for running all periodic health checks.
