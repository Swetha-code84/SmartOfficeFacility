# BEHAVIORAL PATTERN

## Mediator Pattern

                                        Advanced Transaction Coordinator
                                        
The Mediator Pattern is used to centralize the synchronization and control of a complex, multi-step Distributed Transaction among independent services, enforcing an atomic global COMMIT or ROLLBACK decision.

## Strategy Pattern

                                                 Discount Calculator
                                                 
The Strategy Pattern is used to dynamically swap the entire discount calculation algorithm (e.g., between Loyalty Tier and Seasonal Sale) that the Shopping Cart executes, ensuring the final total is calculated using the chosen pricing method at runtime.
