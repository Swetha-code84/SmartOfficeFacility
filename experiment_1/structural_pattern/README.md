# STRUCTURAL PATTERN

## Adapter Pattern

                                               Integrating a New HR Payroll System
                                               
 Adapter Pattern is used to translate the incompatible raw string format from the Legacy Employee Record into the standardized FirstName LastName and numeric salary format expected by the New HR Payroll System.

## Decorator Pattern

                                                   Notification Service 
                                                   
The Decorator Pattern is used to dynamically stack cross-cutting responsibilities (like Timestamping, Encryption, and Audit Logging) onto the core SMS Notifier, allowing features to be added or removed at runtime without altering the original sender's code.
